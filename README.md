# Deloitte-ML-challange-Predict-Loan-Defalturs
This project is a supervised machine learning pipeline designed to predict loan default risk based on applicant and loan-related features. It includes end-to-end data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation using various classification algorithms with proper handling of class imbalance.
Deloitte ML Challenge is a machine learning project that explores multiple supervised classification algorithms to predict loan defaulters or classify customer risk. The project includes implementation of Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting classifiers. Each algorithm is applied on the same dataset, with appropriate preprocessing and model evaluation steps to compare their performance.

This project follows a structured workflow: data cleaning, feature selection, splitting into train-test sets, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The goal is to identify the most effective model for the classification problem, and understand the strengths and limitations of each approach.

Implemented using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, and imbalanced-learn, this challenge helped solidify foundational machine learning skills. It also provided hands-on experience in solving real-world business problems. The project was part of a machine learning competition by Deloitte, and it reflects practical learning during a data science journey at Naresh IT. The author is also exploring Generative AI and deep learning for future endeavors.
